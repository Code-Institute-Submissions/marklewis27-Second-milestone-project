Second milestone project

Project introduction.

The thought behind this project originally was to build a demonstration website showcasing some of the powers of Javascript but i felt that idea lacked a strong theme and i was struggling to make it look as professional as i would have like it to have been.
After some consideration i decided to make a website that gave the user information about a racing series that i am involved in with Radio Control cars. A simple yet affective site that gave the user a clear way of finding out the information you'd need to know before attending one of these events in person.
The design of this site i wanted to be as clean as possible, i didn't want to much going on in the background which is why i have designed the site using a simple background. To match the colors in the background of the purple that is in it i used the adobe color matcher online to find the green color as a good color that matched the purple featured. To go with this i also used a button class from bootstrap that had the green around it to tie it in nicely with the rest of the sites theme.
The colors for the heading and the main text i went  for the white smoke color to make the most important eye catching text really stand out but without being a brilliant white color that might have given a bit to much of a glare to it.
A user that would come on to this site would want to know about the location of the site, the sort of facilities on the site so that they know what they need to bring or not bring themselves. Another important thing to know befroe one of these events is the weather, this can have a huge impact on car setup and tyre choice so a link to the weather for the are that the event is being held is extremely useful to a racer.


Features.

Feature 1. Loading page, by using a combination of css and javascript i gave the page the loading icon to give it a professional loading              theme to enter the site with.
Feature 2. Both of the welcome and regional series pages have smooth loading, rather than the sudden appearance of the site having it blend            on to the screen give the site that softer more user friendly feel.
Feature 3. The welcome page has a button at the bottom with a link to the BRCA website for all the rules and regulations for this class of            racing which a lot of people find helpful to check on from time to time.
Feature 4. In the regional series page the list of venues at the top can be clicked on and the page will smoothly scroll to that venue                information section.
Feature 5. The list of venues also chenge there css proprties when clicked on to remind the user which ones they have clicked on already.
Feature 6. As mentioned before there is a link to the weather forecast for each venue on the site.
Feature 7. Each venure has a list of important information that when hovered over change to italic to catch the users attention is there              mouse hovers over them.

Features left to implement.

Although i do have a map on the page with a close up of the venue i would have liked to make it more interactive with a google maps API however when i looked in to signing up for this the secuirty around the usage of the API seemed a little unclear so i wasn't happy to have something that seemed fairly unguarded link to my debit card details which is why that was not included in this project.


Technologys used.

The site has been built using the bootstrap framework which can be found here ... https://getbootstrap.com/ I used this for the grid system to get the layout i have and also the defualt classes for things such as buttons and the navigation on the site.

The site has Javascript in it to make some of the animations work and some of the features on the site to work based on the user input to give it more interactivity.. https://www.javascript.com/

As part of the design process i used the adobe color wheel that matches colors that work well together to help with the design of the colors on the site ... https://color.adobe.com/create
